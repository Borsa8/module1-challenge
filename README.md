# Module1 Challenge

## Description

This project reflects my first-week learning experience in web development, covering HTML, CSS, Git, and GitHub. My motivation was to consolidate my new skills and showcase my progress. While not solving a specific problem, it serves as a portfolio of my abilities in creating a webpage with HTML,CSS and familiarising myself with Git/GitHub for version control.
